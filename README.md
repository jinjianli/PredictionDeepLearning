# PredictionDeepLearning
This project applies Deep Learning Algorithm (LSTM) to predict traffic flow.

Firstly, we input and range the traffic flow data from local transportation management.

Secondly, the LSTM model is defined and fit

At last, the prediction performance is demonstrated with the trained LSTM model. The average RMSE erre is about 39 veh/h, which is enough good for traffic prediction and can be improved by applying more training data.
